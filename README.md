# Pytorch-Wildlife
  A Collaborative Deep Learning Framework for Conservation
## 🐾 Introduction

At the core of our mission is the desire to create a harmonious space where conservation scientists from all over the globe can unite, share, and grow. We are expanding the CameraTraps repo to introduce **Pytorch-Wildlife**, a Collaborative Deep Learning Framework for Conservation, where researchers can come together to share and use datasets and deep learning architectures for wildlife conservation.

We've been inspired by the potential and capabilities of Megadetector, and we deeply value its contributions to the community. **As we forge ahead with Pytorch-Wildlife, under which Megadetector now resides, please know that we remain committed to supporting, maintaining, and developing Megadetector, ensuring its continued relevance, expansion, and utility.**

To use the newest version of MegaDetector with all the exisitng functionatlities, you can use our newly developed [user interface](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps?tab=readme-ov-file#explore-pytorch-wildlife-and-megadetector-with-our-user-interface) or simply load the model with **Pytorch-Wildlife** and the weights will be automatically downloaded:
```
from PytorchWildlife.models import detection as pw_detection
detection_model = pw_detection.MegaDetectorV5()
```
For those interested in accessing the previous MegaDetector repository, which utilizes the same `MegaDetector v5` model weights and was primarily developed by Dan Morris during his time at Microsoft, please visit the [archive](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/archive) directory, or you can visit this [forked repository](https://github.com/agentmorris/MegaDetector/tree/main) that Dan Morris is actively maintaining.

If you have any questions regarding MegaDetector and Pytorch-Wildlife, please [email us](zhongqimiao@microsoft.com)!
## 👋 Welcome to Pytorch-Wildlife Version 1.0

**PyTorch-Wildlife** is a platform to create, modify, and share powerful AI conservation models. These models can be used for a variety of applications, including camera trap images, overhead images, underwater images, or bioacoustics. Your engagement with our work is greatly appreciated, and we eagerly await any feedback you may have.

The **Pytorch-Wildlife** library allows users to directly load the `MegaDetector v5` model weights for animal detection. We've fully refactored our codebase, prioritizing ease of use in model deployment and expansion. In addition to `MegaDetector v5`, **Pytorch-Wildlife** also accommodates a range of classification weights, such as those derived from the Amazon Rainforest dataset and the Opossum classification dataset. Explore the codebase and functionalities of **Pytorch-Wildlife** through our interactive `Gradio` web app and detailed Jupyter notebooks, designed to showcase the practical applications of our enhancements at [PyTorchWildlife](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md). You can find more information in our [documentation](https://cameratraps.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

👇 Here is a brief example on how to perform detection and classification on a single image using `PyTorch-wildlife`
```
import torch
from PytorchWildlife.models import detection as pw_detection
from PytorchWildlife.models import classification as pw_classification

img = torch.randn((3, 1280, 1280))

# Detection
detection_model = pw_detection.MegaDetectorV5() # Model weights are automatically downloaded.
detection_result = detection_model.single_image_detection(img)

#Classification
classification_model = pw_classification.AI4GAmazonRainforest() # Model weights are automatically downloaded.
classification_results = classification_model.single_image_classification(img)
```
## 🕵️ Explore Pytorch-Wildlife and MegaDetector with Our User Interface

If you want to directly try **Pytorch-Wildlife** with the AI models available, including `MegaDetector v5`, you can use our **Gradio** interface. This interface allows users to directly load the `MegaDetector v5` model weights for animal detection. In addition, **Pytorch-Wildlife** also has two classification models in our initial version. One is trained from an Amazon Rainforest camera trap dataset and the other from a Galapagos opossum classification dataset (more details of these datasets will be published soon). To start, please follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md) on how to run the Gradio interface! We also provide multiple [**Jupyter** notebooks](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/tree/main/demo) for demonstation.
